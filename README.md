## Welcome to aiReplica.xyz

Ever wondered what it's like to talk with your `favorite Characters`? Well now you can!

aiReplica leverages `Meta Llama-2` models to bring to you the latest and most performant machine-learning responses for just about any character creation you can think of!

Try it out at [https://www.aiReplica.xyz/](https://www.aiReplica.xyz/).

The live app is protected by `Clerk authentication` as a simple 1-step signin using `Gmail` as well being a preventative measure agaisnt bot-spamming.

### Beta MVP Access

Anyone can use the app. All you need is to have a Gmail account and it doesn't even have to be your main account!

If you have trouble accessing the app, please shoot me an email over at jasonmai.dev@gmail.com

### Getting Started

Once you've logged in, simply select any of the character `Replicas` that you see on the homepage and start chatting with them. Daily chat is currently limited to 40 messages per day until V1's full release when I have some time to setup a proper pricing model on the infrastructue stack. Nevertheless, the app will always be `free to use` as it will never require any payment information.

### Features Coming to V1

Replica text-to-voice

Image generation

### Vector Stores, Embeddings, & Rate-Limiting Resources + Documentations
